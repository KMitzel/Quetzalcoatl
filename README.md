This is the codebase for FRC Team 2890 in the 2019 competition, Destination: Deep Space

## What is FRC

> Combining the excitement of sports with the rigors of science and technology, we call FIRST Robotics Competition the ultimate Sport for the Mind. High-school student participants call it, “the hardest fun you’ll ever have. Under strict rules, limited resources, and an intense six-week time limit, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to compete in a difficult field game against like-minded competitors. It’s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team. Each season ends with an exciting FIRST Championship.

## About the Game

Kickoff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mew6G_og-PI
Rules: https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2019/Manual/2019FRCGameSeasonManual.pdf

The game consists of two teams of three, red and blue, each placing hatchets (disks with velcro) and cargo (kick balls) 

## About our Robot

What does our robot do?

Our bot has many functions, including a grabber that functions by picking up the ball with spinning wheels. The grabber is composed of a pair of unmoving wheels and a net that help keep the ball in place. Another function is a lift that works by a motor spinning a chain. This lift helps move the grabber to the correct height to deposit the ball into the cargo spot. A hook works by holding the hatch, and releases it by rotating.

Breakdown of hardware

The chasis is a u-style frame which is ideal for our grabber system. This style frees up space in the center of the robot to make room for cargo. The back of the chasis is reserved for the electrical board. Our lift system is very light, therefore we have a very low center of gravity. This makes our robot stable when the lift activates. The lift is composed of chain
